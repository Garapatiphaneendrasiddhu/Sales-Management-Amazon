# Sales Management Using SQL

• Utilized a dataset with over 9,000 rows to simulate real-world scenarios, offering valuable              insights into Amazon's sales operations. 

• Utilized advanced SQL techniques to query large datasets, performing data extraction,               cleaning, and transformation to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

• Used five tables to create an Entity Relationship Diagram that shows the relationships among each table.

• Analyzed and solved real-world business problems using various techniques, demonstrating           proficiency in joins, aggregate functions, clauses, and subqueries.
